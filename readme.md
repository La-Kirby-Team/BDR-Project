# Inventory Management System for Board Games

## Project Overview

This project involves building a relational database system to manage an inventory of board games for a small gaming shop or a personal collection. The application will allow users to catalog games, track inventory levels, add new acquisitions, and manage sales transactions. The goal is to create a user-friendly system with robust backend support using PostgreSQL for the database and a simple web or desktop interface.

## ER Model

The ER model for the Board Game Inventory System consists of the following entities:
- **Game** (GameID, Name, Genre, Price)
- **Supplier** (SupplierID, Name, Contact)
- **Stock** (StockID, GameID, Quantity, ReorderLevel)
- **Sale** (SaleID, Date, GameID, Quantity, CustomerName)

---

## Relational Model

Based on the ER model, the relational schema is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Game (
    GameID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Genre VARCHAR(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Supplier (
    SupplierID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Contact VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Stock (
    StockID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    GameID INT REFERENCES Game(GameID),
    Quantity INT,
    ReorderLevel INT
);

CREATE TABLE Sale (
    SaleID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Date DATE,
    GameID INT REFERENCES Game(GameID),
    Quantity INT,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(255)
);
