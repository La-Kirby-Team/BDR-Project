# Project Specifications
## Project: Wine Cave Inventory Management System (Wineventory)

### 1. **Project Overview**
The **Wineventory** project aims to develop a relational database system to manage a wine cave's inventory, allowing users to track wine stocks, handle new acquisitions, and manage wine removals. The goal is to create an efficient, user-friendly system tailored to the needs of private or professional wine cave owners.

---

### 2. **Project Objectives**
The objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a relational database to store information about wines, suppliers, and inventory movements.
- Enable efficient stock management: view current levels, handle wine removal, and receive low-stock alerts.
- Track the history of inventory changes, including added and removed wines, with reasons (e.g., sold, gifted, consumed).
- Provide a clear and responsive user interface for managing daily tasks.

---

### 3. **Scope of Work**
The system will allow users to:
- Add new wines with detailed information such as name, varietal, vintage, price, and supplier.
- Remove wines from inventory with reasons (sold, gifted, consumed, etc.).
- Monitor real-time stock levels and receive alerts for low stock.
- View the full history of added and removed wines.
- View the stock levels and movements of all products across other stores within the chain.
- Access customer purchase history to send them offers or predict their visit frequency, allowing for advanced stock preparation.
